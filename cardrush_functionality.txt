SOLD LISTINGS DATA using ebay-average-selling-price
https://rapidapi.com/ecommet/api/ebay-average-selling-price

We need to basically remake all of the functionality for current listings but with sold listings
we'll change to using sold listings data as the primary driver for ROI

Need a 'SoldListingsModel' to store sold listings because we dont want to actually request these when clicking on the row
like we do with live data.

Use sold data to determine approximate popularity (more sales = more popularity, figure out where to store this - card model?)

CSV uploads
    Create ui to upload and start the ImportCards process

---
 GROUPS

   better ui to create GROUPS
   better ui for viewing a group
--- 

Create a 'popularity' algorithm to sort cards by popularity
    - blocked sold data (liquidity?)



Create a 'Generate List' functionality to generate a list of cards based on a set of filters & popularity
  -- Lets you 're-roll' with a few options. 
  -- lets you 'fill' empty slots with a few options
  -- add total consistently
  -- add estimated profit?
--

'Undercut alert' functionality. Essentially when checking a cards ebay data,
if we notice darkhoundoom in the list and its not the lowest list, create a model row
and store it somewhere that we can see.


==== BATCHES ==

Add Auth to Batch and use that to log if a card has been listed recently. 
    Can do lots of functionality with this Batch to Card link (ie on card page show, last listed X days ago etc)

Add 'custom sku' customality
Add 'combine duplicates' option
Add a 'total list value' to Batch
