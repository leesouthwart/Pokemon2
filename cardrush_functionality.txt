SOLD LISTINGS DATA using Countdown API

We need to basically remake all of the functionality for current listings but with sold listings
we'll change to using sold listings data as the primary driver for ROI

Need a 'SoldListingsModel' to store sold listings because we dont want to actually request these when clicking on the row
like we do with live data.

Use sold data to determine approximate popularity (more sales = more popularity, figure out where to store this - card model?)

--


Add a 'Region selector' which will change the current currency and we'll use this to determine region



All this because we dont have to have GBP listings in the AUS users and vice versa

Add AUS and US regions
--

Create a 'favourites' list and the ability to add cards to it. Per User (so check auth)

Add Auth to Batch and use that to log if a card has been listed recently. Can do lots of functionality with this Batch to Card link

--

Create a 'popularity' algorithm to sort cards by popularity

--
Setup Command to consistently update card data. Figure out how we want to schedule these.
    - CR Data
    - eBay Data
--

Create a 'Generate List' functionality to generate a list of cards based on a set of filters & popularity
   - stock check before adding to list

--

'Undercut alert' functionality. Essentially when checking a cards ebay data,
if we notice darkhoundoom in the list and its not the lowest list, create a model row
and store it somewhere that we can see.
