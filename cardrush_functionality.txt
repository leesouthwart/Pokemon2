pagination on card list

--

Add a 'card_region' concept so that we can have the same card in multiple regions
Add a 'Region selector' which will change the current currency and we'll use this to determine region
When doing the ebay API request, change data based on region and then store based on region

Make 'ebay fee' and shipping fees configurable per user

All this because we dont have to have GBP listings in the AUS users and vice versa

If a user adds a card via form, it should run for both regions.

--

Create a 'favourites' list and the ability to add cards to it. Per User (so check auth)

Add Auth to Batch and use that to log if a card has been listed recently. Can do lots of functionality with this Batch to Card link

--

Create a 'popularity' algorithm to sort cards by popularity


--

Create a 'Generate List' functionality to generate a list of cards based on a set of filters & popularity

--

Use sold data to determine approximate popularity
